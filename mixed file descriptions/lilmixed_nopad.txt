3h of mixed files
speaker 2 mixed with random speech from speakers 1 31 with snr -9,-6,-3,0,3,6.

mixed=y1+y2
max_amp = max(abs(mixed(:)));
mix_scaling = 1/max_amp;
mixed = mix_scaling * mixed;

power of each signal is found and then they're added proportional to snr 
then the maximum of abs of mixed is found and mixed file is divided into the max
